## Proposition

Do you think it would be a good idea to organize a hackathon to develop applications that would help institutions, doctors, teachers to solve real COVID-19 related problems?

## Process
The process would be something like:
 - Propose an idea (through an RFC issue on github)
   - Should respond to a real need/urge
   - Open-source and free 
   - Be prototypable in less than a week  
 - Organize a live event to pitch it
 - If there are a lot of ideas, organize a vote to focus on the best/urgent ones
 - Init a github repo/organisation for contributions
 - Organize a discord/slack/whatever channel for the project
 - Craft the application in a week or less
 - Demo the application
 - Vote on the best application

## Price
A price for the best idea with a contribution from everyone; we'll see how to organize this.

Feel free if you have better suggestions.
